Some python scripts to manage rotating zfs snapshots via cron/anacron.

Includes customizable numbers of snapshots to keep for
daily/weekly/monthly or arbitrary interval snapshots.

Also includes functions to synchronize snapshots (recursively) over ssh.

This started out as a collection of shell scripts (see git history)
but I rewrote it completely in python for better functionality and
better scriptability.
